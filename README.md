# tf_in_working
This repo is for Practice of Tensorflow codes, the list below contains the basic layout of the all the implementations of the basic tensorflow functions.

This repo also contains the codes of various courses based on tensorflow library such as "Tensorflow in Practice Specialization", as well as my kaggle codes submissions.

### List Of the Folders:
 
## 1) Kaggle: 
   - Titanic-1:  
      A binary classification problem, with basic concepts of normalization by sklearn, data clearning,
      getting stated with kaggle competetions,
      with almost 72% accuracy.

## 2) tf_basic: 
   - basic-intro:                                     
      Getting started with tf, a linear regression problem with function like model, compile, fit etc.
      
   - fashion-minist-dataset:
